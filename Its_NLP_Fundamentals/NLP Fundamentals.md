## üß© What Is Tokenization?

Tokenization is the process of breaking down a sequence of text into smaller units called **tokens**. These tokens can be:
- Words
- Subwords
- Characters
- Phrases

### Example:
```text
Sentence: "PyTorch tokenization becomes easy"
Tokens: ["PyTorch", "tokenization", "becomes", "easy"]
```

---

## üß† Why Tokenization Matters in NLP

Tokenization is the **first and most essential step** in any NLP pipeline. Before a model can understand or generate text, it must convert raw sentences into structured tokens.

### Key Reasons:
- Enables numerical representation of text
- Helps models learn patterns and relationships
- Prepares data for embeddings and training

---

## üß± Types of Tokens

Depending on the strategy, tokens can vary:
- **Word-level**: Each word is a token
- **Subword-level**: Words are split into smaller parts (e.g., "tokenization" ‚Üí "token", "ization")
- **Character-level**: Each character is a token

### Strategy Choice:
- Depends on language complexity
- Influences model performance and vocabulary size

---

## üîç Visualizing Tokenization with OpenAI Tokenizer

The video demonstrates tokenization using OpenAI‚Äôs tokenizer interface.

### Example Input:
```text
"With PyTorch, tokenization becomes easy"
```

### Output:
- **Token count**: 8
- **Character count**: 38
- Each word is split into smaller chunks based on encoding rules

### Adding More Words:
```text
"With PyTorch, tokenization becomes easy and everyone can do it"
```
- **Token count**: 14
- **Character count**: 64

This shows how token count increases with sentence length.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up PyTorch Tokenization

To implement tokenization in PyTorch, the video uses the `torchtext` library.

### Required Tool:
- `torchtext` ‚Äî a PyTorch NLP toolkit

---

## üì¶ Installing torchtext

Use pip to install:
```bash
pip install torchtext
```

This library includes tokenizers, datasets, and preprocessing tools for NLP tasks.

---

## üß∞ Using `get_tokenizer` from torchtext

Import the tokenizer:
```python
from torchtext.data.utils import get_tokenizer
```

### Available Tokenizers:
- `"basic_english"` ‚Äî splits text using simple English rules
- Others include `"spacy"`, `"moses"`, `"toktok"`

---

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Tokenizing a Sample Sentence

Define your input text:
```python
text = "With PyTorch, tokenization becomes easy and everyone can do it"
```

Initialize tokenizer:
```python
tokenizer = get_tokenizer("basic_english")
```

Apply tokenizer:
```python
tokens = tokenizer(text)
```

---

## üñ®Ô∏è Printing and Understanding Token Output

Print the tokens:
```python
print(tokens)
```

### Output:
```text
["with", "pytorch", "tokenization", "becomes", "easy", "and", "everyone", "can", "do", "it"]
```

Each word is now a separate token, ready for embedding or model input.

---

## üß¨ Why Tokenization Is Crucial for Language Models

Before training any NLP model ‚Äî especially large language models (LLMs) ‚Äî tokenization is a must.

### Real-World Use:
- GPT, BERT, and other LLMs tokenize billions of sentences
- Tokenization enables models to learn grammar, semantics, and context

### Without Tokenization:
- Models cannot process raw text
- No way to convert words into numerical form

## üß© What Are Word Embeddings?

Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words in a high-dimensional space. They allow machines to understand relationships between words based on their meaning and usage.

### Key Concepts:
- Each word is mapped to a vector of real numbers.
- Similar words have similar vectors.
- Embeddings capture **semantic** (meaning) and **syntactic** (structure) relationships.

---

## üß† Why Word Embeddings Matter in NLP

Embeddings are the foundation of modern NLP models. They transform raw text into numerical form, enabling deep learning models to process language.

### Benefits:
- Capture word similarity and context.
- Reduce dimensionality compared to one-hot encoding.
- Enable transfer learning via pre-trained models.

---

## üì¶ Understanding GloVe

**GloVe** stands for **Global Vectors for Word Representation**. It‚Äôs an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns word embeddings from word co-occurrence statistics in a corpus.

### Features:
- Trained on massive datasets (Wikipedia, Common Crawl).
- Embeddings available in various dimensions (50, 100, 200, 300).
- Captures global context better than Word2Vec.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installing Required Libraries

You‚Äôll need:
- `torch`
- `torchtext`

### Installation:
```bash
pip install torch torchtext
```

These libraries provide tools for tokenization, vocabulary management, and embedding layers.

---

## üì• Importing PyTorch and torchtext Modules

```python
from torchtext.data.utils import get_tokenizer
from torchtext.vocab import GloVe
import torch
```

These imports allow access to:
- Tokenizer functions
- Pre-trained GloVe embeddings
- Tensor operations

---

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Tokenizing Text

Tokenization splits text into individual words or subwords.

### Sample Code:
```python
text = "This is my first word embedding project"
tokenizer = get_tokenizer("basic_english")
tokens = tokenizer(text)
print(tokens)
```

### Output:
```text
['this', 'is', 'my', 'first', 'word', 'embedding', 'project']
```

Each word is now a token, ready for embedding.

---

## üß∞ Creating GloVe Embedding Object

Initialize GloVe with desired dimension:
```python
glove = GloVe(name='6B', dim=100)
```

### Parameters:
- `name='6B'`: Refers to the 6 billion token corpus.
- `dim=100`: Each word will be represented by a 100-dimensional vector.

---

## üî¢ Converting Tokens to Indexes

Use GloVe‚Äôs `stoi` (string-to-index) method:
```python
indexes = [glove.stoi[token] for token in tokens]
print(indexes)
```

### Note:
- Misspelled or unknown words may raise a KeyError.
- Ensure correct spelling before embedding.

---

## üß¨ Generating Word Embeddings

Convert indexes to vectors:
```python
embeddings = glove.vectors[indexes]
print(embeddings)
```

Convert to PyTorch tensor:
```python
embeddings = torch.tensor(embeddings)
```

Now each word is represented as a dense vector.

---

## üìê Printing Embeddings and Shape

Check the shape of the embedding matrix:
```python
print(embeddings.shape)
```

### Example Output:
```text
torch.Size([7, 100])
```

This means:
- 7 tokens
- Each represented by a 100-dimensional vector

---

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

This tutorial walks through the full pipeline:
1. Raw text ‚Üí Tokenization
2. Tokens ‚Üí Indexes
3. Indexes ‚Üí Embeddings

### Why It Matters:
- Embeddings are the input to NLP models.
- Pre-trained vectors like GloVe save time and improve accuracy.
- PyTorch + torchtext make implementation simple and modular.

## üß≠ Introduction to Transformers

Transformers are a type of deep learning architecture introduced in the 2017 paper *‚ÄúAttention is All You Need‚Äù* by Google researchers. They revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by replacing older models like RNNs and LSTMs with a parallelizable, attention-based system.

### Key Features:
- **Parallel processing**: Unlike RNNs, Transformers process entire sequences simultaneously.
- **Contextual understanding**: They capture long-range dependencies between words.
- **Scalability**: Transformers scale well with data and compute, enabling massive models like GPT-4.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Language Models & Word Prediction

A language model is a system trained to predict the next word in a sentence. This simple task underpins powerful applications like autocomplete, translation, and chatbots.

### Example:
- Input: ‚ÄúI made a sweet Indian rice dish‚Ä¶‚Äù
- Output: ‚ÄúKheer‚Äù, ‚ÄúPongal‚Äù, ‚ÄúBiryani‚Äù ‚Äî depending on context.

### GPT vs BERT:
- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: Predicts next word (causal language modeling).
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Understands context from both directions (masked language modeling).

---

## üî¢ Word Embeddings

Words must be converted into numbers for machines to process them. This conversion is called **embedding** ‚Äî a vector representation of a word.

### Static Embedding Example:
- ‚ÄúKing‚Äù ‚Üí [Authority: 1, Rich: 1, Gender: -1, Tail: 0]
- ‚ÄúQueen‚Äù ‚Üí [Authority: 1, Rich: 1, Gender: 1, Tail: 0]

### Vector Math:
```text
King - Man + Woman ‚âà Queen
```
This shows how semantic relationships can be encoded in vector space.

---

## üß± Static vs Contextual Embeddings

### Static Embeddings:
- Fixed meaning for each word.
- Models: Word2Vec, GloVe.
- Limitation: Cannot adapt to sentence context.

### Contextual Embeddings:
- Meaning changes based on surrounding words.
- Example:
  - ‚ÄúTrack‚Äù in ‚Äútrain track‚Äù ‚â† ‚Äútrack my package‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúDish‚Äù in ‚Äúrice dish‚Äù ‚â† ‚Äúcheese dish‚Äù

Transformers generate contextual embeddings using attention mechanisms.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Transformer Architecture Overview

Transformers consist of two main components:

### 1. Encoder
- Processes input sentence.
- Generates contextual embeddings for each word.

### 2. Decoder
- Uses encoder output + previous words.
- Predicts next word or translates sentence.

Each component contains:
- Multi-head attention layers.
- Feedforward neural networks.
- Positional encoding.
- Layer normalization and residual connections.

---

## üîÑ Encoder & Decoder Roles

### Encoder:
- Converts input tokens into rich contextual embeddings.
- Captures relationships between all words in the input.

### Decoder:
- Uses encoder output and previously generated tokens.
- Predicts next token step-by-step.
- Used in tasks like translation and text generation.

### Architecture Variants:
- **BERT**: Encoder-only.
- **GPT**: Decoder-only.
- **T5, BART**: Encoder-decoder.

---

## üéØ Attention Mechanism

Attention allows each word to focus on other relevant words in the sentence.

### Example:
- Sentence: ‚ÄúI made a sweet Indian rice dish.‚Äù
- Word: ‚ÄúDish‚Äù
- Relevant modifiers: ‚ÄúSweet‚Äù, ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù, ‚ÄúRice‚Äù

Each modifier contributes a weighted influence to the meaning of ‚ÄúDish‚Äù.

### Attention Scores:
- ‚ÄúSweet‚Äù ‚Üí 36%
- ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù ‚Üí 14%
- ‚ÄúRice‚Äù ‚Üí 18%
- ‚ÄúI‚Äù ‚Üí 2%

These scores are computed using dot products between query and key vectors.

---

## üìö Query, Key, Value Analogy

### Library Analogy:
- **Query**: ‚ÄúI want a book on quantum computing.‚Äù
- **Key**: Labels on shelves (e.g., ‚ÄúScience‚Äù, ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù).
- **Value**: Actual book content.

### Transformer Analogy:
- Each word has:
  - **Query vector**: What it wants to know.
  - **Key vector**: What it offers.
  - **Value vector**: Its contribution.

Attention = dot product between query and key ‚Üí weighted sum of values.

---

## üß† Multi-Head Attention

Instead of one attention mechanism, Transformers use multiple heads.

### Why?
- Each head focuses on different aspects:
  - Head 1 ‚Üí Adjectives
  - Head 2 ‚Üí Verbs
  - Head 3 ‚Üí Pronouns
  - Head 4 ‚Üí Cultural context

### Benefit:
- Captures diverse relationships in parallel.
- Improves model‚Äôs ability to understand complex language patterns.

---

## üîÑ Feedforward Network

After attention, each word‚Äôs embedding is passed through a feedforward neural network.

### Purpose:
- Adds non-linear transformations.
- Refines and enriches the contextual embedding.

### Structure:
- Input layer ‚Üí Hidden layer ‚Üí Output layer
- Same dimensionality as input embedding (e.g., 768 for BERT)

This step helps model learn higher-order features beyond attention.

---

## üèãÔ∏è Training & Backpropagation

Transformers are trained on massive datasets using self-supervised learning.

### Training Steps:
1. Input sentence ‚Üí Predict next word.
2. Compare prediction with actual word ‚Üí Compute error.
3. Backpropagate error ‚Üí Update weights (WQ, WK, WV).
4. Repeat over millions of sentences.

### Vocabulary:
- GPT: ~50,000 tokens
- BERT: ~30,000 tokens

Each token has a static embedding vector stored in a lookup matrix.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Summary

Transformers are powerful architectures that:
- Convert words into rich embeddings.
- Use attention to understand context.
- Predict or generate text using encoder-decoder structure.

### Key Takeaways:
- GPT uses decoder-only for generation.
- BERT uses encoder-only for understanding.
- Multi-head attention and feedforward layers enrich token representations.
- Training involves massive data and backpropagation.
