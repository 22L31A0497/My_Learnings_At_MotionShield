# Machine Learning Types

## Types of Machine Learning  
- Supervised Learning  
- Unsupervised Learning  
- Reinforcement Learning  
- Semi-Supervised Learning  

***

### Supervised Learning  
**Definition:**  
Supervised learning trains models on labeled datasets where each input is paired with a correct output. The goal is to learn a function to map inputs to the correct outputs to predict unseen data accurately.

**Types:**  
- **Classification:** Predicts discrete labels (e.g., spam or not spam).  
- **Regression:** Predicts continuous numeric values (e.g., house prices).

**Common Algorithms and Examples:**  
- **Logistic Regression:** Used for binary classification, such as disease detection (yes/no).  
- **Decision Tree:** Predicts outcomes by splitting data based on feature values (e.g., customer churn prediction).  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Finds optimal boundaries to separate classes in complex datasets (e.g., image classification).  
- **Random Forest:** Ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting (e.g., fraud detection).  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classifies based on neighbors’ majority class (e.g., recommendation systems).  
- **Naive Bayes:** Probabilistic classifier used in spam filtering and sentiment analysis.

**Performance Metrics:**  
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.  
- Regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R Square.

***

### Unsupervised Learning  
**Definition:**  
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The model finds hidden patterns or groupings without predefined outcomes.

**Types:**  
- **Clustering:** Groups similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation).  
- **Association:** Finds relationships between variables (e.g., market basket analysis).

**Common Algorithms and Examples:**  
- **K-Means Clustering:** Groups data into a fixed number of clusters based on feature similarity (e.g., grouping users by purchasing behavior).  
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Builds a hierarchy of clusters represented as a tree (e.g., document organization).  
- **DBSCAN:** Density-based clustering to find clusters with varying shapes and identify outliers (e.g., anomaly detection).  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces dimensionality of data to simplify feature space.

**Performance Evaluation:**  
No direct accuracy metric—validity assessed using cluster cohesion, silhouette score, or manual evaluation.

***

### Reinforcement Learning  
**Definition:**  
An agent learns by interacting with an environment through actions, receiving rewards or penalties, aimed at maximizing cumulative rewards.

**Examples:**  
- Game playing AI (e.g., chess, Go).  
- Robot motion control (learning to walk or manipulate objects).  
- Traffic signal optimization.

**Performance Metrics:**  
Cumulative reward, convergence speed, policy effectiveness.

***

### Semi-Supervised Learning  
**Definition:**  
Uses a small amount of labeled data along with large amounts of unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy.

**Example:**  
Improving image classification accuracy by training on few labeled images combined with many unlabeled ones.

***



# Regression and Classification

**Definition:**  
- **Regression:** Predicts continuous numeric values based on input data. Used for problems where output is a real value, like prices or temperatures.  
- **Classification:** Predicts discrete categories or labels. Used for problems where output is a category, like spam or not spam, or disease or no disease.

**Types:**  
- Regression: Linear regression, polynomial regression (non-linear)  
- Classification: Binary classification (two classes), multi-class classification (more than two classes)

**How it works:**  
- Regression tries to fit a line or curve (best-fit line) to data points to predict numerical outputs.  
- Classification tries to find decision boundaries that separate data into different classes.

**Examples:**  
- Regression: Predict house price based on size, predict temperature tomorrow  
- Classification: Email spam detection, image recognition (cat vs dog), cancer detection (malignant vs benign)

**Performance Metrics:**  
- Regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R²  
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

***

# Linear Regression Algorithm

**Definition:**  
Linear Regression models the relationship between one or more input variables (features) and a continuous target variable by fitting a straight line.

**Equation:**  
$$
y = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x
$$  
Where:  
- $$y$$ is the predicted output  
- $$x$$ is the input feature  
- $$\theta_0$$ is the intercept (value of $$y$$ when $$x=0$$)  
- $$\theta_1$$ is the slope (change in $$y$$ for unit change in $$x$$)

**Goal:**  
Find the best-fitting line that minimizes the distance (error) between the actual and predicted values.

**Error Measurement:**  
- Uses the squared error (difference squared) between actual and predicted values, summed across all points. This is called the cost function:  
$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m (h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2
$$  
where $$m$$ is number of data points, $$h_{\theta}(x)$$ is the predicted value.

**Optimization Technique:**  
- Gradient Descent: Iteratively adjusts $$\theta_0$$ and $$\theta_1$$ to minimize the cost function until the best fit is found.

**Example:**  
If you have data of age vs weight, linear regression can predict weight for a new age based on the fitted line.

***



# R-Squared (Coefficient of Determination) and Best Fit Line in Linear Regression

### What is R-Squared?

- **R-squared** (denoted as $$ R^2 $$) is a statistical measure used to evaluate how well a regression model fits the data.
- It tells how much of the variation (or variability) in the dependent variable $$ y $$ can be explained by the independent variable(s) $$ x $$.
- The value ranges from 0 to 1.
  - $$ R^2 = 1 $$ means the model perfectly fits the data (all variation explained).
  - $$ R^2 = 0 $$ means the model explains none of the variation (no predictive power).

***

### Why is R-Squared Important?

- It shows the **goodness of fit** — how well the regression line represents the data points.
- Helps in comparing different models: higher $$ R^2 $$ means better fit.
- Indicates how reliable the predictions from the model are.

***

### How is R-Squared Calculated?

1. **Calculate the mean** of the observed dependent variable $$ y $$:
   $$
   \bar{y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n y_i
   $$
2. **Total Sum of Squares (SST or $$ SS_{tot} $$)**: Measures total variance in the data around the mean:
   $$
   SS_{tot} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2
   $$
3. **Residual Sum of Squares (SSR or $$ SS_{res} $$)**: Measures the variance not explained by the model, sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values:
   $$
   SS_{res} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
   $$
   where $$ \hat{y}_i $$ are predicted values from the regression line.
4. **R-squared formula:**
   $$
   R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}
   $$
- Intuitively, $$ R^2 $$ measures proportion of variance explained by the regression; rest is unexplained error.

***

### What is the Best Fit Line?

- The **best fit line** in linear regression is the straight line that minimizes the total **squared differences** between the actual data points and the predicted points on the line.
- This is called **minimizing the residual sum of squares** (RSS or SSR).
- Equation of line (hypothesis):
  $$
  \hat{y} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x
  $$
  where $$\theta_0$$ = intercept, $$\theta_1$$ = slope.
- The parameters $$\theta_0$$ and $$\theta_1$$ are chosen such that $$ SS_{res} $$ is minimized.

***

### How to Find the Best Fit Line? (Optimization)

- Use **Gradient Descent** or **Normal Equation** methods to find $$\theta_0$$ and $$\theta_1$$.
- Gradient descent:
  - Start with random $$\theta$$ values.
  - Iteratively update them to reduce the cost function $$ J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum (h_{\theta}(x_i) - y_i)^2 $$.
  - Stop when changes are very small or cost is minimized.
- The best fit line corresponds to the minimal cost function, lowest error between predicted and actual points.

***

### Important Notes:

- High $$ R^2 $$ means the line fits data well, but beware of overfitting.
- $$ R^2 $$ does not indicate if the model is appropriate or if predictors cause the changes.
- Adjusted $$ R^2 $$ accounts for number of predictors, useful when comparing models with different predictors.

***

### Summary Example:

- If $$ R^2 = 0.8 $$, it means 80% of the variation in $$ y $$ is explained by the independent variable $$ x $$.
- The remaining 20% is due to other factors or noise.

# Ridge and Lasso Regression Algorithms

***

### What is the Problem They Solve?

- When there are **many features** (input variables) or **high correlation** between features (multicollinearity), traditional linear regression can **overfit**.  
- Overfitting means the model fits training data very well but performs poorly on new/unseen data.  
- To prevent this, **regularization** techniques add a penalty to the model complexity in the loss function.

***

### Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

- Ridge regression adds a **penalty proportional to the square of the magnitude** of coefficients to the cost function.  
- This penalty shrinks the coefficients toward zero but **does not set any coefficient exactly to zero**.  
- Formula of cost function for Ridge Regression:  
$$
Loss = \text{MSE} + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2
$$
where $$\lambda$$ is the regularization parameter controlling penalty strength, $$w_i$$ are the feature coefficients.

- **Purpose:** Reduce overfitting by shrinking coefficients, especially useful when many correlated features exist.

- **Effect:** Keeps all features but reduces their impact by shrinking coefficients, improving model generalization.

***

### Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

- Lasso regression adds a **penalty proportional to the absolute value** of the magnitude of coefficients.  
- This penalty can shrink some coefficients **exactly to zero**, thus performing **automatic feature selection**.  
- Formula of cost function for Lasso Regression:  
$$
Loss = \text{MSE} + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^n |w_i|
$$

- **Purpose:** Select important features and reduce dimensionality by removing irrelevant or less important features.

- **Effect:** Produces simpler, more interpretable models by excluding some variables entirely.

***

### Key Differences Between Ridge and Lasso

| Aspect               | Ridge Regression                                    | Lasso Regression                                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Type of Regularization | L2 (squares of coefficients)                        | L1 (absolute values of coefficients)            |
| Feature Selection    | No automatic feature removal; all features kept    | Performs feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero |
| Coefficients Shrinking | Coefficients get smaller but non-zero               | Some coefficients shrink exactly to zero         |
| When to use          | When all features are potentially relevant         | When only a subset of features is important       |
| Model Complexity     | Models are more complex                              | Models are simpler due to feature selection       |
| Example Use Case     | Predicting house prices considering all features   | Genetic studies where only few genes matter       |

***

### When to Use Which?

- Use **Ridge Regression** when you want to retain all features but reduce overfitting, especially in data with multicollinearity or many predictive features.  
- Use **Lasso Regression** when you want simpler models that automatically identify and keep only the most important features, helpful in high-dimensional data scenarios.

***

### Limitations

- Both methods require careful tuning of the penalty parameter $$\lambda$$, usually done via cross-validation.  
- Features usually must be standardized (scaled) before applying these methods.  
- In cases of highly correlated features, Ridge keeps all correlated features; Lasso picks one and excludes others, which might not always be desirable.

***

### Summary

Ridge and Lasso Regression are powerful regularization methods improving linear regression by preventing overfitting and enhancing model interpretability. Ridge shrinks coefficients without removing features, while Lasso can remove some, effectively performing feature selection.

# Logistic Regression Algorithm

***

### What is Logistic Regression?

- Logistic Regression is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used mainly for **classification problems**, specifically binary classification (two classes).  
- Unlike linear regression which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts the **probability** that an input belongs to a certain class (e.g., yes/no, success/failure).  
- It outputs a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the positive class.

***

### Why Logistic Regression?

- Linear regression can predict values from $$-\infty$$ to $$+\infty$$, which is not suitable for classification where outputs need to be between 0 and 1.
- Logistic regression uses a **sigmoid function** (also called logistic function) to convert any real number into a value between 0 and 1.

***

### Logistic Function (Sigmoid Function)

The sigmoid function formula is:  
$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$
- Where $$ z = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \theta_n x_n $$ (linear combination of input features with weights).
- It maps any real-valued number $$ z $$ into a value between 0 and 1.
- The output $$\sigma(z)$$ is interpreted as the probability $$P(y=1|x)$$.

***

### Model Equation

- The logistic regression hypothesis function:  
$$
h_\theta(x) = \sigma(\theta^T x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta^T x}}
$$
where $$ \theta^T x = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \theta_n x_n $$.

- The output $$h_\theta(x)$$ gives the probability that $$ y=1 $$ given input $$x$$.

***

### Decision Boundary

- Logistic regression predicts class labels based on a **threshold** (usually 0.5).  
- If $$ h_\theta(x) \geq 0.5 $$, predict class 1 (positive class); else predict class 0 (negative class).
- The decision boundary is the set of points where $$ h_\theta(x) = 0.5 $$, or equivalently $$ \theta^T x = 0 $$.

***

### Parameter Estimation: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

- Parameters $$ \theta $$ are estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, which finds parameters making the observed data most probable.
- The **likelihood function** $$L(\theta)$$ is defined as the probability of the observed data given parameters $$\theta$$.
- The **log-likelihood function** is maximized using optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent, Newton's Method, or Quasi-Newton methods.

***

### Loss Function: Log Loss (Cross Entropy)

- Logistic regression uses **log loss** (or cross-entropy) as the cost function to minimize:  
$$
J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left[ y^{(i)} \log(h_\theta(x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log(1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)})) \right]
$$
where $$m$$ is the number of training examples.

- This penalizes wrong predictions heavily and encourages probabilities close to the true labels.

***

### Advantages of Logistic Regression

- Simple and easy to implement.  
- Outputs probabilities that can be interpreted.  
- Effective for binary and multi-class (using extensions) classification.

***

### Limitations

- Assumes a linear relationship between input features and the log-odds of the outcome.  
- Can't capture complex relationships without feature engineering or kernel methods.  
- Sensitive to outliers and multicollinearity.

***

### Real-World Use Cases

- Email spam detection (spam or not spam).  
- Disease diagnosis (sick or not sick).  
- Customer churn prediction (will leave or stay).  
- Credit risk assessment (default or not).  

***

# Naive Bayes Algorithm

***

### What is Naive Bayes?

- Naive Bayes is a **probabilistic classification algorithm** based on **Bayes' Theorem**.  
- It assumes that the features are **conditionally independent given the class** (the "naive" assumption).  
- It calculates the probability that a given input belongs to each class and picks the class with the highest probability.

***

### Bayes’ Theorem Formula

$$
P(C|X) = \frac{P(X|C) \times P(C)}{P(X)}
$$

- $$P(C|X)$$: Probability of class $$C$$ given features $$X$$ (posterior probability).  
- $$P(X|C)$$: Probability of features $$X$$ given class $$C$$ (likelihood).  
- $$P(C)$$: Prior probability of class $$C$$.  
- $$P(X)$$: Total probability of features $$X$$.

***

### How Naive Bayes Works?

1. Calculate prior probability for each class from training data.  
2. Calculate likelihood probability for the features given each class.  
3. Use Bayes’ theorem to calculate posterior probability for each class.  
4. Choose the class with the highest posterior probability as prediction.

***

### Types of Naive Bayes

- **Gaussian Naive Bayes:** Assumes continuous features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.  
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes:** For discrete features like word counts; commonly used in text classification.  
- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes:** For binary/boolean features.

***

### Example (Spam Email Classification)

- Classes: “Spam” and “Not Spam”.  
- Features: Presence or frequency of certain words.  
- Given a new email, Naive Bayes calculates the probability of “Spam” and “Not Spam” based on word features and predicts the class with a higher probability.

***

### Pros and Cons

- **Pros:** Simple, fast, effective for text classification, requires less training data.  
- **Cons:** Assumes feature independence often doesn’t hold, can perform poorly if features are correlated.

***

# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

***

### What is KNN?

- KNN is a **lazy, instance-based learning algorithm** used for classification and regression.  
- It makes predictions based on the **closest training examples** (neighbors) in the feature space.

***

### How KNN Works?

1. Choose $$K$$ (number of neighbors to look at).  
2. Compute the distance (e.g., Euclidean distance) between test point and all training points.  
3. Sort the distances and pick the top $$K$$ closest neighbors.  
4. For classification, predict the class that appears the most among the neighbors (majority vote). For regression, average the neighbors’ numerical values.

***

### Distance Metrics

- **Euclidean Distance:**  
$$
d = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2}
$$  
- **Manhattan Distance, Minkowski Distance** are other options.

***

### Example (Classifying a New Iris Flower)

- Dataset: Iris flower with features like petal length, sepal width, and corresponding classes (species).  
- Given a new flower’s measurements, calculate distances from all flowers in the training set.  
- Take the majority class of the 3 nearest neighbors (if $$K=3$$) as the predicted species.

***

### Pros and Cons

- **Pros:** Simple to understand and implement, no model training phase.  
- **Cons:** Slow for large datasets (computes distances for all points), sensitive to irrelevant features and scale of data, choice of $$K$$ impacts results.

***

## Naive Bayes Algorithm

***

### What is Naive Bayes?

- Naive Bayes is a **probabilistic classification** algorithm based on **Bayes’ Theorem**, with the "naive" assumption that features are independent given the class.
- It calculates the probability of each class given the input features and predicts the class with the highest probability.
- Commonly used for text classification, spam detection, sentiment analysis, etc.

***

### Bayes’ Theorem Formula:

$$
P(C|X) = \frac{P(X|C) \times P(C)}{P(X)}
$$

Where:
- $$P(C|X)$$: Posterior probability of class $$C$$ given features $$X$$.
- $$P(X|C)$$: Likelihood of features $$X$$ given class $$C$$.
- $$P(C)$$: Prior probability of class $$C$$.
- $$P(X)$$: Evidence (probability of features $$X$$).

***

### How It Works Step-by-Step:

Let’s classify if **the golf game will be played** given the conditions:    
$$X = (\text{Sunny}, \text{Mild}, \text{Normal}, \text{False})$$.

**Dataset Features:**  
- Outlook: Sunny, Overcast, Rain  
- Temperature: Hot, Mild, Cool  
- Humidity: High, Normal  
- Wind: True, False  
- Target: Play (Yes or No)

***

### Step 1: Calculate Prior Probabilities $$P(\text{Play})$$  
From data:  
- $$P(\text{Yes}) = \frac{9}{14}$$  
- $$P(\text{No}) = \frac{5}{14}$$

***

### Step 2: Calculate Likelihoods for each feature value given class  
For example, for Play = Yes:  
- $$P(\text{Sunny} | \text{Yes}) = \frac{2}{9}$$  
- $$P(\text{Mild} | \text{Yes}) = \frac{4}{9}$$  
- $$P(\text{Normal} | \text{Yes}) = \frac{6}{9}$$  
- $$P(\text{False} | \text{Yes}) = \frac{6}{9}$$  

For Play = No:  
- $$P(\text{Sunny} | \text{No}) = \frac{3}{5}$$  
- $$P(\text{Mild} | \text{No}) = \frac{2}{5}$$  
- $$P(\text{Normal} | \text{No}) = \frac{1}{5}$$  
- $$P(\text{False} | \text{No}) = \frac{2}{5}$$

***

### Step 3: Calculate Posterior for each class  

$$
P(\text{Yes} | X) = P(\text{Sunny} | \text{Yes}) \times P(\text{Mild} | \text{Yes}) \times P(\text{Normal} | \text{Yes}) \times P(\text{False} | \text{Yes}) \times P(\text{Yes})
$$

$$
= \frac{2}{9} \times \frac{4}{9} \times \frac{6}{9} \times \frac{6}{9} \times \frac{9}{14} = 0.0635
$$

Similarly,

$$
P(\text{No} | X) = \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{5}{14} = 0.0069
$$

***

### Step 4: Predict the class with the highest posterior  

Since $$P(\text{Yes} | X) > P(\text{No} | X)$$, the model predicts **Yes**, meaning golfing will occur under the given conditions.

***

### Summary of Naive Bayes:

- Uses Bayes’ theorem to compute probabilities.
- Assumes independence of features.
- Handles categorical data well.
- Fast and efficient for many classification problems.

***

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

***

### What is KNN?

- A simple, intuitive algorithm for classification and regression.
- Predicts the class of a new data point based on the classes of its **K nearest neighbors** in the feature space.
- Distance metric (Euclidean distance) measures closeness.

***

### How KNN Works Step-by-Step (Classification):

- Given a new data point, compute distance to all training points.
- Pick the $$K$$ closest points (neighbors) to the query point.
- The majority class among these neighbors is the predicted class.

***

### Example:

Predict whether a flower belongs to species A or B based on petal length and width:

| Flower | Petal Length | Petal Width | Species |
|--------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| 1      | 1.0          | 0.5         | A       |
| 2      | 1.2          | 0.4         | A       |
| 3      | 1.5          | 0.6         | B       |
| 4      | 1.3          | 0.7         | B       |

- For a new flower with petal length=1.1 and petal width=0.5:
  - Calculate distances to all flowers.
  - Find the 3 nearest neighbors.
  - If 2 neighbors are species A and 1 is species B, predict **A**.

***

### Summary of KNN:

- Non-parametric and lazy learner (no training phase).
- Sensitive to feature scaling and irrelevant features.
- $$K$$ controls bias-variance tradeoff (small $$K$$ = high variance, large $$K$$ = high bias).
- Commonly used for simple classification problems.
