# 🧠 OpenCV with Python

## 🧭 1. What is OpenCV?

### 🔍 Definition
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a cross-platform library for real-time computer vision.
- Available in Python, C++, and Java.

### 🧠 Purpose
- Helps extract insights from images and videos.
- Used in deep learning applications like object detection, face recognition, and image classification.

---

## 🛠️ 2. Course Setup

### 🐍 Python Version
- Recommended: Python 3.7 or above.
- Check version using `python --version`.

### 📦 Required Packages
- `opencv-contrib-python`: Full OpenCV package including community-contributed modules.
- `numpy`: For matrix and array operations.
- `seer`: A custom utility package built by the instructor to simplify workflows (used later in the course).

## 🖼️ 3. Reading Media Files

### 🖼️ Reading Images
- Images are read as pixel matrices.
- OpenCV treats images as arrays of pixel values (height × width × color channels).

### 🎥 Reading Videos
- Videos are read frame-by-frame using a loop.
- Can read from:
  - Webcam (using integer index like `0`)
  - Video file (using file path)

### 🧠 Key Concepts
- Each video frame is treated like an image.
- Reading media involves capturing and displaying frames using OpenCV methods.

## 📏 4. Rescaling and Resizing

### ⚙️ Why Resize?
- Large images/videos consume more memory and processing power.
- Resizing helps optimize performance and fit content to screen.

### 📐 Rescaling vs. Resolution Change
- **Rescaling**: Adjusts image size by a scale factor (e.g., 75% of original).
- **Resolution Change**: Sets explicit width and height (used for live video only).

### 🧠 Best Practices
- Always downscale for performance.
- Use scale factors for static media; use resolution settings for live feeds.

## 🖍️ 5. Drawing on Images

### 🧱 Creating Blank Images
- Blank images are arrays filled with zeros (black canvas).
- Useful for drawing shapes and testing visual features.

### 🟩 Drawing Shapes
- **Rectangle**: Defined by two corner points.
- **Circle**: Defined by center and radius.
- **Line**: Defined by start and end points.

### ✍️ Writing Text
- Text can be added using built-in fonts.
- Requires position, font type, scale, color, and thickness.

## 🧰 6. Basic Image Operations

### 🌑 Grayscale Conversion
- Converts color image (BGR) to grayscale.
- Useful for simplifying image data and reducing computation.

### 🌫️ Blurring
- Removes noise and smooths image.
- Gaussian blur is commonly used.

### 🧱 Edge Detection
- Canny edge detector identifies boundaries in images.
- Uses threshold values to detect strong and weak edges.

---

## 🧪 7. Image Morphology

### 🔍 Dilation
- Expands white regions in binary images.
- Makes edges thicker.

### 🧼 Erosion
- Shrinks white regions.
- Removes small noise and refines edges.

---

## ✂️ 8. Resizing and Cropping

### 📐 Resize
- Changes image dimensions to a fixed size.
- May distort aspect ratio if not handled carefully.

### ✂️ Crop
- Selects a region of interest (ROI) using array slicing.
- Useful for focusing on specific parts of an image.


## 🔄 1. Image Transformations

### ✈️ Translation (Shifting Images)
- Moves the image along the X and/or Y axis.
- Positive X → right, Negative X → left.
- Positive Y → down, Negative Y → up.
- Useful for aligning or repositioning objects in an image.

### 🔁 Rotation
- Rotates the image around a point (usually the center).
- Angle can be positive (counterclockwise) or negative (clockwise).
- Can rotate around any custom point, not just the center.

### 📐 Resizing
- Changes the dimensions of the image.
- Can shrink or enlarge.
- Interpolation methods:
  - `INTER_AREA`: Best for shrinking.
  - `INTER_LINEAR` / `INTER_CUBIC`: Better for enlarging (cubic is higher quality but slower).

### 🔄 Flipping
- Flips the image:
  - Vertically (over X-axis)
  - Horizontally (over Y-axis)
  - Both (X and Y)

### ✂️ Cropping
- Extracts a region of interest (ROI) from the image.
- Done using pixel slicing (like array slicing).

## 🧭 2. Contour Detection

### 🧱 What Are Contours?
- Contours are curves that join continuous points along the boundary of an object.
- Think of them as outlines or edges of shapes.

### 🧠 Why Use Contours?
- Essential for:
  - Shape analysis
  - Object detection
  - Image segmentation

### 🧰 How Contours Are Found
- Convert image to grayscale.
- Apply edge detection (e.g., Canny).
- Use `findContours()` to extract contour points.

### 🧪 Contour Modes
- `RETR_LIST`: Retrieves all contours.
- `RETR_EXTERNAL`: Only outermost contours.
- `RETR_TREE`: Retrieves all with hierarchy info.

### 🧱 Contour Approximation
- `CHAIN_APPROX_NONE`: Stores all contour points.
- `CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE`: Compresses points (e.g., a line becomes just 2 endpoints).

---

## 🧼 3. Preprocessing for Contours

### 🌫️ Blurring Before Contour Detection
- Reduces noise and small details.
- Helps in detecting cleaner, fewer contours.

### ⚫ Thresholding (Alternative to Canny)
- Converts grayscale image to binary (black & white).
- Pixels above a threshold → white; below → black.
- Simpler than Canny but less flexible.

---

## 🖍️ 4. Drawing Contours

### 🧾 Visualizing Contours
- Contours can be drawn on:
  - Original image
  - Blank canvas (for clarity)
- Helps in debugging and understanding object boundaries.
