## 1. Digital Image Basics

### ðŸ“˜ Explanation

* **Pixels:** Images are made of very tiny squares called pixels. Each pixel stores a color value. In **grayscale**, itâ€™s a number between 0 (black) and 255 (white). In **RGB**, every pixel has three numbers: \[Red, Green, Blue].
* **Resolution:** Number of pixels in an image (width Ã— height). Higher resolution â†’ more details.
* **Types of Images:**

  * Black & White (binary): Only 0 or 1
  * Grayscale: 0â€“255 shades
  * RGB: Full color
  * Binary Mask: Used in segmentation â†’ 0 = background, 1 = object

### ðŸ’» Sample Code

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load an image
img = cv2.imread('car.jpg')
print("Image shape (height, width, channels):", img.shape)

# Convert to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
print("Grayscale pixel value at (50, 50):", gray[50, 50])

# Display grayscale image
cv2.imshow('Grayscale Image', gray)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## 2. Segmentation Concepts

### ðŸ“˜ Explanation

* **Object Detection:** Finds objects with rectangles (bounding boxes).
* **Semantic Segmentation:** Colors every pixel but does not separate objects of the same type.
* **Instance Segmentation:** Draws exact **pixel masks for each object separately** (e.g., 2 dents = 2 masks).
* **Why YOLOv8m?** It can detect and segment damages like **scratches, dents, cracks** precisely.
* **Masks:** Binary images showing where the damage is (1 = damage, 0 = background).

### ðŸ’» Sample Code

```python
import numpy as np
import cv2

# Create a blank mask
mask = np.zeros((512, 512), dtype=np.uint8)

# Draw a white rectangle (simulate damage area)
mask[100:200, 150:250] = 1

# Show mask (multiply by 255 for display)
cv2.imshow('Damage Mask', mask * 255)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## 3. Training Fundamentals

### ðŸ“˜ Explanation

* **Epoch:** One complete pass of the dataset during training.
* **Epoch Count:** Normally 50â€“100 gives good results.
* **Loss Functions:**

  * **Box Loss:** How well the bounding box fits.
  * **Class Loss:** How well the class (scratch, dent, etc.) is predicted.
  * **Segmentation Loss:** How well the mask matches the damage shape.

### ðŸ’» Sample Code

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load YOLOv8m pretrained segmentation model
model = YOLO("yolov8m-seg.pt")

# Train model on custom dataset (dataset.yaml)
model.train(data="dataset.yaml", epochs=60, imgsz=640)
```

## 4. Damage Percentage Calculation

### ðŸ“˜ Explanation

We can calculate **how much of the car is damaged** by comparing mask pixels:

$Damage% = (Mask Pixels Ã· Car Pixels) Ã— 100$

* **Mask Pixels:** Pixels marked as damage.
* **Car Pixels:** Pixels belonging to the car body.

### ðŸ’» Sample Code

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load masks (grayscale)
damage_mask = cv2.imread('damage_mask.png', 0)
car_mask = cv2.imread('car_mask.png', 0)

# Count pixels
damage_area = np.count_nonzero(damage_mask)
car_area = np.count_nonzero(car_mask)

# Calculate damage %
damage_percent = (damage_area / car_area) * 100
print(f'Damage Percentage: {damage_percent:.2f}%')
```
